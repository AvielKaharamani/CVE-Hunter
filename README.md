# Project dependencies CVE finder

## Description

This project is an executable program that helps find open CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in any given Python project, and offers a fix version. It reads the project's requirements file (requirements.txt for Python), parses it, and retrieves all project dependencies. Then, for each dependency, it finds its open CVEs and their closest fix version. Finally, it prints out a table with the following headers: Dependency Name | Current Dependency Version | CVE ID | Fix version | CVE Description.

## Usage

To run the program, open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the program is located. Then, type the following commands:

```
python cve-hunter.py -r [path-to-requirements-file]
``` 

## Dependencies

The program is written in Python and requires the following libraries to be installed:

- requests
- argparse
- logging
- configparser
- datetime

## Limitations

The program has the following limitations:

- It relies on external websites to retrieve information about the project dependencies and their CVEs, which may not always be up-to-date.
